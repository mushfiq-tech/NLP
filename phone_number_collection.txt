Course Name : NLP-5 by Innovative Skills
My Name : Musfiqur Rahman Sanim (Musfiq)
Project Name : Requirement analysis for collecting phone numbers- NLP Pipeline

Domain: Phone Number Collection (Clothing Showroom)
Target Skill: Google maps places API, Selenium, spaCy,scikit-learn,Gensim,BERT,Tensorflow,pytorch
                streamlit,Matplotlib.

Feasibility Check: 
    Expences = $0.003 per Contact Data request
        https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/usage-and-billing
    
Data Collection: (Generalize)
    1. Existing Dataset(open sourse)
        -Local Machine
        -Database Paid API(SQL)
    2. Less Data 
        -Augmentation(Data Generation)

For Google : Google places API

*If Dataset isnt available in your computer
    - Public Dataset: Web scrapping,Mannual, Survey

Data Cleaning:
    -Tokenization = Break the comments into words or tokens.
    -Lowercasing = Convert all text to lowercase.
    -Stopword Remooval = Remove common words (the,is etc).
    -Lemmatization / Stemming = Reduce words to their root forms.
    -Removing Punctuation = Remove unnecessary symbols.
    -Handling Emoticons/Emojis = convert or remove emojis as per requirements.
    -Handling URLs = remove or replace URLs with placeholders. 
    -Hashtags and Mentions = Remove or replace them with placeholders.

Data Validation:
    - By own or any Expert or freelance data validator

Model Development:
    Feature Extraction:
        - Bag of Words(BoW) = Create vector for each comment based on word frequency.
        - TF-IDF (weight) = Words importance relative to corpus
        - word Embeddings = Use Pre-trained models like word2vec,Glove,BERT to capture semantic meaning.
        - Sentiment-Specific Features = Identify words and phrases and assign scores.

    Sentiment analysis Model:(Classify the sentiment of each comment e.g., positive , negative,neutral).
        - Rule-Based sentiment analysis = use predefined lexicon of words with sentiment scorces.
        - Machine learning Classifier = Train a sentiment Classifier (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random forest).
        - Deep Learning = Use LSTM or Transformers (BERT) for more advanced sentiment Classification.

Model Evaluation:(Evaluate model performance)
    -Metrics
        = Accuracy
        = Precisiom , recall
        = Confusion Matrix
    
Post-Processing and visualization:
    - Display Sentiment distribution( chart of positive , negative , neutral comments)
    - Visualize word clouds of positive/negative comments to identify trends.

Model Deployment:
    -Build a REST API using Flask or FastAPI.
    - Integrate with a web application or dashboard (Streamlit or ccutom front end)
