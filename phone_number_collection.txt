    -How would you optimize your search queries for efficiency?
    =I would set precise latitude and longtitude as well as I would be much precise with Radius.

Process Design:
    -Outline a step-by-step process to extract phone numbers of such showrooms manually.
        =Set up Google Cloud and get an API key.
        =Query the Google Places API> Filter out showrooms lacking websites..

    -What measures would you implement to ensure data accuracy?
        = That is really the toughest part and it requires many steps and accuracy.
            1. Validate and Cross-Check API Responses
            2. Handle and Review Partial Data
            3. Use Fallback Methods for Verifying Phone Numbers
            4. Rate Limit and Error Handling
            5. Implement Data Validation Rules
            6. Check for Real-Time Changes
            7. Leverage Reviews or User-Generated Data for Verification
            8. Implement Geographical Validation
            9. Monitor Changes in API Responses
            10. Regularly Update Data from the API
            11. Consider Using Data Quality Metrics
            12. Manual Auditing

        =Monitor and stay within the usage limits and quotas set by Google, using proper rate limiting in the application.
        =Avoid Reselling Data
        =Delete or anonymize data after the purpose is fulfilled, complying with Google’s retention and usage rules

Validation of Results:
    -Once you collect the phone numbers, how will you verify their accuracy and relevance?
        =Validate phone numbers against other business directories or public listings.
        =Ensure numbers are in valid formats (e.g., country code, correct length).
        =Randomly test a subset of phone numbers by calling or manually checking business listings.
        =Re-query businesses periodically to capture changes or updates in contact details.
    -Suggest ways to handle duplicate or outdated entries.
        =Compare entries by name, address, phone number, or place_id and merge similar records.
        =Track updates with timestamps to identify outdated entries.
        =Rely on place_id or other unique fields to avoid duplication.
        =Periodically refresh data from the source to ensure current and accurate information.
