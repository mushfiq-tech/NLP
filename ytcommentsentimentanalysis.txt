Project Name : Youtube comment sentiment analysys - NLP Pipeline

Domain: Social Media sentiment analysys (Youtube)
Target Skill: Youtube Data API, Selenium, spaCy,scikit-learn,Gensim,BERT,Tensorflow,pytorch
                streamlit,Matplotlib.

Feasibility Check: Possible or not on Preset Time and Budget.

Data Collection: 
1. Existing Dataset(open sourse)
    -Local Machine
    -Database Paid API(SQL)
2. Less Data 
    -Augmentation(Data Generation)

*Dataset isnt available in your computer
    - Public Dataset: Web scrapping,Mannual, Survey

Data Validation:
    - By own or any Expert or freelance data validator

Feature Extraction:
    - Bag of Words(BoW) = Create vector for each comment based on word frequency.
    - TF-IDF (weight) = Words importance relative to corpus
    - word Embeddings = Use Pre-trained models like word2vec,Glove,BERT to capture semantic meaning.
    - Sentiment-Specific Features = Identify words and phrases and assign scores.

Sentiment analysys Model:(Classify the sentiment of each comment e.g., positive , negative,neutral).
    - Rule-Based sentiment analysys = use predefined lexicon of words with sentiment scorces.
    - Machine learning Classifier = Train a sentiment Classifier (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random forest).
    - Deep Learning = Use LSTM or Transformers (BERT) for more advanced sentiment Classification.

Evaluation:(Evaluate model performance)
    -Metrics
        = Accuracy
        = Precisiom , recall
        = Confusion Matrix
    
Post-Processing and visualization:
    - Display Sentiment distribution( chart of positive , negative , neutral comments)
    - Visualize word clouds of positive/negative comments to identify trends.

Deployment:
    -Build a REST API using Flask or FastAPI.
    - Integrate with a web application or dashboard (Streamlit or ccutom front end)
